## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run the Eltrix bot on your own server.

### 1. Prerequisites

* **Python 3.11** or newer. Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
* A **Discord Bot Token**. You can create a bot application and get a token via the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
    * ‚ö†Ô∏è **ATTENTION:** Ensure you enable the **Privileged Gateway Intents** (`Server Members Intent` and `Message Content Intent`) for your bot in the Developer Portal.

### 2. Repository Cloning

Download the code to your machine.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Eltrix-Dot/Eltrix-Discord.bot](https://github.com/Eltrix-Dot/Eltrix-Discord.bot)
cd Eltrix-Discord.bot
3. Package Installation
The bot requires a few Python libraries to run. Make sure your requirements.txt includes the necessary packages and execute the following command:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Bot Configuration
Open the ELTRIX.py file and fill in the configuration section at the top. This is the most crucial step.

Python

# =============================================================================
# 1. CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# Bot Token (Keep this SECRET!)
TOKEN = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
# Guild ID (The ID of your server)
GUILD_ID = 123456789012345678
# Log channel ID (The ID of the channel for logs)
LOG_CHANNEL_ID = 123456789012345678
# Staff IDs (Role IDs of your staff)
STAFF_ROLE_IDS = {
    123456789012345678, # Staff Role ID
    123456789012345679, # Admin Role ID
}
# Owner ID (Your own user ID)
OWNER_ID = "YOUR_USER_ID_HERE"
# ... (Further configuration like TICKET_CATEGORIES etc. follows in the file)
üîé How to find IDs? Enable "Developer Mode" in Discord: User Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode. Then, right-click on a server, channel, role, or user and select "Copy ID".
